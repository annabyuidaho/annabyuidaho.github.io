	<h2>Beginner - $550</h2>
	<img src="images/salmon-cabins.jpg" alt="cabins">
	<p>Our Beginner trip costs $550. What's included in this package is all you will need for a 2-night trip on the river. This price includes the cost of your meals, rental of your gear (life jacket, helmet, paddle, etc) and lodging. This package is a great way to "get your feet wet" in the raft. You'll also be close to "home" so if you decide another night isn't for you, you can return easily back to our origin. But, we think you'll have such a great time, that that won't happen!</p>

	<p>This trip will give you the chance to try something new. We hope you'll love it! We're going to teach you ways to be safe and have fun! You're going to experience water in a whole new way!  </p>

	<h2>Intermediate - $730</h2>
	<img src="images/deso-boats.jpg" alt="rafters together">
	<p>Our Intermediate trip costs $730. This trip has a 4-night tour on the lake. We promise it will be better than the famous 3-hour tour! This trip includes the cost of two meals and you'll be roughing it for your third meal. Two nights will be in the cabins and the other two will be in tents. We wanted to make this more advanced than the Beginner, but get you ready for the Advanced. </p>

	<p>This trip will give you the opportunity to do more with rafting that you have done before. You'll be stretched in ways you didn't know you could be strechted in. You're going to love this trip! </p>

	<h2>Advanced - $970</h2>
	<img src="images/salmon-adv.jpg" alt="rafter in the rapids">
	<p>Our advanced trip cost $970. We start you off easy with this trip and for the first two nights of this 7-night trip, you have the option to stay in our cabins. If you feel like roughing it for the whole trip, that's totally okay! The cost of the trip includes two-meals each day. You will be roughing it for the other meal all seven days. The cost will include the price of the 2-night stay in the cabins, whether you choose to stay there those nights or to be in your tents, the price is the same.</p>

	<p>With this trip you'll have the opportunity to see more of the water and get more experience in rough waters. You'll be able to get away from the hectic world and just be in nature for seven whole days! You're going to love it!</p>

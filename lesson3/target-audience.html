			<h2>Scenarios</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Scenario 1: The track meet begins the morning. Will it be cold then? What will the weather be in the afternoon?</li>

				<li class="listans">The site will provide the current weather as well as an 18-hour hourly forecast.</li>

				<li>Scenario 2: I need to travel to Utah for a funeral. What will the weather be there, so I know what to pack?</li>

				<li class="listans">The site will have an option to change the location. In addition the hourly forecast, there will also be a daily forecast for an estimate of weather.</li>

				<li>Scenario 3: It rained a lot last night. I have to commute in to work. Will it still be raining during my commute?</li>

				<li class="listans">The site will have current weather. It should be easy to gauge the weather for the commute.</li>

				<li>Scenario 4: I have family coming in for Thanksgiving. It's starting to snow right now. Will the snow lighten up by the time they get here?</li>

				<li class="listans">That can easily be checked on the site. For the 18-hour hourly forecast, it will list the chance of preciptation.</li>

				<li>Scenario 5: There is a tornado warning. How do I know where that is and how long it lasts?</li>

				<li class="listans">When there is dangerous weather at the location you are looking at, there will be an alert on the site. That alert will tell you which counties and cities are affected. It will also tell you how long the warning is in effect.</li>
